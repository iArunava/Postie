# Postie

Postie is an Extension developed using WebExtension that helps users save Linkedin Posts. Users can save posts with just **one click**. This extension modifies the Linkedin content in place to give an option to save the post within the post itself. So you can save posts while browsing, without even moving to another window/tab.
